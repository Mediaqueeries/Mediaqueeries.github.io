        <h1 id="title"><span>A Beginning:</span> A Call To Action For Radical LGBTQ Narratives In Tech</h1>

        <hr>

        <p> I've spent a long time looking. I've chased down narratives of
            queer folks in tech, of kick-ass trans language developers, of
            lesbian web programmers whose brilliance shines every time they
            give a conference talk, of the unfortunate stories of gay men whose
            CEO's crack jokes about being gay. Then there's the trauma that the
            tech industry itself perpetuates on folks in various LGBTQ
            communities. The ignorance of products to women's and trans and
            non-binary health, the displacement of trans homeless youth, the
            massive conference expenditures and six figure salaries in the face
            of gentrifying queer communities in San Francisco, Austin,
            Portland, Seattle, New York, and on, and on, and on.  </p>

        <p> Some of these stories aren't exclusive to the tech world, but I'm
            trying to point to a glaring questions I so rarely see answered in
            tech, the first of which is: where are the LGBTQ people?  </p>

        <p> At first glance, one might say queer narratives are so rare
            because there are so few queer people to begin with. Okay,
            sure, but without even getting into <a
                href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/how-many-people-are-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender/">the
                statistics</a>, an average representation of 0% is
            certainly nowhere near parity with the reality — there are
            queer people in tech, somewhere. We need more inclusion across
            all spectrums of diversity, in this and other industries, but
            there's usually only blank stares when someone does ask about
            LGBTQ inclusion; that the statistics don't exist, that no one's
            thought about it before. I've had to look through webs of
            Twitter followers and their mentions, through related Tumblr
            blogs, through the occasional blog post to find, maybe, a few
            dozen narratives about being queer in tech. From the outside
            looking in, you might think there's almost no space for queer
            people in tech. And you might be right; on average, you're
            probably more likely to encounter rigidly binary notions of
            gender because "it's easier to program" into a database, to be
            immersed in hyper-sexualized, heteronormative, male dominated
            workplace cultures, and the daily conflation of sex, gender,
            and sexuality in our product design.  </p>

        <p>
            I've spent a long time looking for queer voices in tech and I'm tired of
            waiting for it to get better. Let's write about making queer apps. Let's write
            about breaking binary systems in products (gender and otherwise). Let's talk
            about how assuming static identities traps us into a name, a gender, or a
            pronoun. Let's talk about the problems the tech industry simply hasn't solved
            for LGBTQ communities, how we can start building solutions for ourselves, and
            how allies might help (and when allies need to take a hint, sit down and
            support queer folk). I'm sure there are queer issues in tech I haven't even
            thought of yet! If you have a queer tech story to tell, I'd love to hear it.
            The dream I keep having is for a queer kid, like myself a few years ago, to be
            able to—someday—wonder what it means to be queer and to build things in this
            industry, and be able to know. To know that we are smart, and confident, and
            strong. To know that we exist and we have voices of our own. Let's write these
            stories down; something is bound to come of it.
