            <h2 id="subtitle">A Call To Action For LGBTQ Narratives In Tech</h2>
            <hr>

            <p> I've spent a long time looking. I've chased down narratives
                of queer folks in tech, of the kick-ass trans language
                developers, of lesbian web programmers whose brilliance
                shines every time they give a conference talks, of the
                unfortunate stories of gay men whose CEO's—in small,
                cramped, five/six person startups, mind you—crack jokes
                about being gay. Then there's the trauma that the tech
                industry itself perpetuates. The ignorance of products to
                women's and trans and non-binary health, the displacement
                of young trans homeless youth, the massive conference
                expenditures and six figure salaries that aren't enough to
                compensate for gentrifying queer communites in San
                Francisco, Austin, Portland, Seattle, New York, and on, and
                on, and on.  </p>

            <p> Some of these stories aren't exclusive to the tech world, but
                I'm trying to point to a glaring questions I so rarely see
                answered in tech, the first of which is: where are the LGBTQ
                people?  </p>

            <p> At first glance, one might say queer narratives are so rare
                because there are so few queer people to begin with. Okay,
                sure, but without even getting into <a
                    href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/how-many-people-are-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender/">the
                    statistics</a>, an average representation of 0% is
                certainly nowhere near parity with the reality — there are
                queer people in tech, somewhere. We need more inclusion across
                all spectrums of diversity, in this and other industries, but
                there's usually only blank stares when someone does ask about
                LGBTQ inclusion; that the statistics don't exist, that no one's
                thought about it before. I've had to look through webs of
                Twitter followers and their mentions, through related Tumblr
                blogs, through the occasional blog post to find, maybe, a few
                dozen narratives about being queer in tech. From the outside
                looking in, you might think there's almost no space for queer
                people in tech. And you might be right; on average, you're
                probably more likely to encounter rigidly binary notions of
                gender because "it's easier to program" into a database, to be
                immersed in hyper-sexualized, heteronormative, male dominated
                workplace cultures, and the daily conflation of sex, gender,
                and sexuality in our product design.  </p>

            <p>
                I've spent a long time looking for queer voices in tech and I'm tired of
                waiting for it to get better. Let's write about making queer apps. Let's write
                about breaking binary systems in products (gender and otherwise). Let's talk
                about how assuming static identities traps us into a name, a gender, or a
                pronoun. Let's talk about the problems the tech industry simply hasn't solved
                for LGBTQ communities, how we can start building solutions for ourselves, and
                how allies might help (and when allies need to take a hint, sit down and
                support queer folk). I'm sure there are queer issues in tech I haven't even
                thought of yet! If you have a queer tech story to tell, I'd love to hear it.
                The dream I keep having is for a queer kid, like myself a few years ago, to be
                able to—someday—wonder what it means to be queer and to build things in this
                industry, and be able to know. To know that we are smart, and confident, and
                strong. To know that we exist and we have voices of our own. Let's write these
                stories down; something is bound to come of it.
